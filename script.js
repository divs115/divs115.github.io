    "filmBlurb": "This web series episode won Best Comedy Short as the 2018 Silicon Beach Film Festival, Best Web Series at the 2018 Life After Life Film Festival, and was a semi-finalist at the 2018 LA Cinefest and an official selection at the 2018 Los Angeles IFS Film Festival.The coverage is  minimal, but the central scene, in which the mother critiques her daughters' boyfriends, required careful use of reaction shots to highlight the actors' comedic chops and the subtle conflict building between our protagonists as they compare each others' partners and compete for their mother's good graces."
